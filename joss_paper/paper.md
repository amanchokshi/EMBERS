# Summary

*EMBERS* is a python package which package provides a modular framework for radio telescope and interferometric arrays such as the 
MWA^[https://www.mwatelescope.org], HERA^[http://reionization.org/] and the upcoming SKA^[https://www.skatelescope.org/] to accurately measure the all sky 
beam-patterns of their antennas using weather and communication satellites. The data acquired by experiments described in  [Chokshi et al., in prep] and 
[@JLBLine_2018] can be used to generate all 


The source code for the *EMBERS* project can be at https://github.com/amanchokshi/EMBERS, with detailed documentation at https://embers.readthedocs.io.
