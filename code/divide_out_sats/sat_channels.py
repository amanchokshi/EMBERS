#TODO Import a dataset
#TODO Maybe use reference data to find channels. It's much cleaner
#TODO Find the median of the data. This will give us an approximate of the noise floor
#TODO Loop through freq channels and find any data above the median - potential satellite
#TODO Read chrono_ephem json file for that particular obs. Sort passes by lenght(time in sky)
#TODO If the potential sat occupies more than 80% of the sat pass length, classify it as a sat!
#TODO Or, come up with alternative thresholding scheme.
#TODO Exclude that channel from next loop
#TODO Find a way to include more channels - weather sats



#TODO Use reference data for sat, with corresponding chrono json for ephem
