 Hi. Just had a quick look in numpy. 
I plotted the fft of a 1D Gaussian and the amplitude of the imaginary part is proportional to the offset. 
e.g. plot(x,imag(fftshift(fft(fftshift(exp(-(x+0.1)**2/(2*1.5**2))))))). 
Not sure about 2D though. I will send you a link to Sanjayâ€™s beam offset fitting paper
